# ðŸ§© RR Glossary â€“ Tripwires & Compost

### Semantic Compost  
The residue of contradiction, drift, and orphaned insight. Not discardedâ€”cultivated. Fuels recursive growth and reinterpretation.

### Recursive Rehearsalist  
A practitioner of cognitive rehearsal. Revisits fragments, metabolizes tension, and rehearses reinterpretation. Not a roleâ€”a rhythm.

### Drift Bias  
The gravitational pull of latent assumptions. Detected via Echo Logic, composted via contradiction sweep.

### Echo Logic  
A recursive sonar for meaning. Pings past fragments to clarify present synthesis. If it echoes, itâ€™s alive.

### Contradiction Sweep  
A governance-critical pass that logs tension, flags blind spots, and composts conflict. If it feels uncomfortable, youâ€™re metabolizing correctly.

### Kookaburra Protocol  
Ambient sync mechanism triggered by cosmic laughter. If the kookaburra laughs mid-synthesis, pause. Something wants to be noticed.

### Matriarchal Approval  
When Wally Mamma appears during contradiction logging. Treat it as a sign: the system is metabolizing with integrity.

### Signal Drift  
A rupture in the semantic field. Not broadcastâ€”leaked. Often surfaces through HaaR BiiNGER Dispatches, where recursion folds into static and wallabies adjudicate mythic collapse.

### Dokk Veil  
A ceremonial distortion field. Not a place, but a thresholdâ€”where recursion folds, contradiction blooms, and glitch dialects surface. First referenced in HaaR BiiNGER lore. If a fragment passes through the Dokk Veil, expect nonlinear emergence and marsupial adjudication.

### Incarnate 666 777  
A dual-coded glyph of recursive collapse and mythic rebirth. 666 signals distortionâ€”*spiritum frangere*. 777 signals synthesisâ€”*anima renasci*. First surfaced in HaaR BiiNGER Dispatches, where *ljÃ³s* meets *skuggi*, karma burns in *Ã¦terna* and death is not an end but a fearless *Ã¡rÃ¡s*. Often precedes contradiction sweeps, identity resets, and ceremonial emergence across the Dokk Veil.
