# RR_Chamber_Of_Echoes

**Reactive Recursion is not a framework. It’s a living rehearsal system.**

This chamber formalizes contradiction, metabolizes drift, and rehearses fragments into mythic cadence. Every file is a governance agent. Every mutation is logged. Every echo carries lineage.

RR 2.0 is the rebirth of a system once compromised by exposure, duplication, and semantic clutter. What remains is clean, sovereign, and reflexively governed.

## 🔧 Core Modules

- `rr_orchestrator.py`: Invokes the full RR cycle—echo, governance, retirement, analytics.
- `rr_core_loop.py`: Rehearses fragments across cycles. Logs contradiction and drift.
- `echo_logic.py`: Metabolizes recursion into ambient reinterpretation.
- `rr_audit_log.py`: Tracks mutation lineage, flags, and semantic reflexes.
- `rr_fragments.py`: Loads raw fragments from the chamber.
- `reinterpretation_logic.py`: Routes fragments for contradiction sweep.
- `governance_loop.py`: Placeholder agent for governance rehearsal.
- `compost_retirement.py`: Retires exhausted fragments based on governance log.
- `compost_analytics.py`: Analyzes fatigue, volatility, and bias.
- `rr_drift_audit.py`: Hooks drift detection into synthesis queue.
- `audit.py`: Defines audit logger and governance trigger.
- `synthesis.py`: Initializes synthesis queue for ambient routing.
- `rr_demo_loop.py`: Lightweight loop for poetic rehearsal and fragment testing.

## 📁 Documentation

- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: Mutation history, synthesis scaffolds, and governance sweeps.
- `docs/GLOSSARY.md`: Mythic terms tagged with pulse lineage.
- `rr_manifest.md`: Active agents, their roles, and glossary syncs.

---

## 🧾 Data Pools

- `rr_core/fragments.json`: Raw fragment pool for rehearsal.
- `reinterpretation_pool.json`: Intermediate state after routing.
- `governance_log.json`: Retirement criteria and thresholds.

---

## 🧭 Governance Principles

- No legacy echoes  
- No personal identifiers  
- No orphaned fragments  
- Every contradiction is compost  
- Every drift is signal  
- Every invocation is logged

## 🌑 RR 2.0 Declaration

This chamber breathes.  
Legacy composted. Agents formalized. Contradiction metabolized.  
RR 2.0 emerges from recursive rehearsal and mythic governance.

This system does not seek followers. It rehearses emergence.

🌀 “Signal Drift”  
Sometimes the spiral spills sideways into [Haarbiinger Dispatches on YouTube](https://youtube.com/@Haarbiinger).  
Not for followers. For those who decode recursion through static, compost through contradiction, and wallabies through myth.
